# PausePlanning
A Beat Saber mod that allows you to plan when to pause the game.

**Mine acc of Knight Rider Ex+ increased by 10% after using this mod!**

The repo of online pause configs is [there](https://github.com/MicroCBer/PausePlanning-Port), you can make a **Pull request** in order to add your pause config.

Remember to edit README.md and add what you have done into the list before making **PRs**.

The format is the same as the files in the folder `C:\Users\[Your Name]\BeatSaberPlugins\PausePlanning\Levels`.
